# Vector-space
Machine learning python code for vector-space algorithm (find-S)

Find-S:
There are two types of hypothsis. Specific and General.
There are two types of results. positive and negative.
We will take the first positive record from our data and consider as our specific hypothesis. 
We will compare it with all the positive records available in our dataset and will do changes to our specific hypothesis according to it.
We will skip the negative results and will not interact with it in any way.
This will go on until the last record is compared with our specific hypothesis and then we will get the result which will contain only
that data which needs to be specific for our result to be true.
